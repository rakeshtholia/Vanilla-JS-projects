# Vanilla-JS-projects
I learn by doing, so created around 15 projects, using plain javascript. Happy learning

If you are also a begineer in javascript, then follow this video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=4392s) and create your first projects in javascript. After this you will have hands on knowlege on js and easily able to grasp js frameworks also.
